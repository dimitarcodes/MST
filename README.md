# Minimum Spanning Tree search algorithm
This is my implementation of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Search algorithm. 

## Input
There are a few options for inputting the graph for which we're trying to find an MST:
1. Randomly generated via calling the function with 2 integer arguments - number of vertices and top boundary for the weight of the edges.
2. Using a text file, additional testing files are in the zip file in this project.
3. Manually inputting the 2 dimensional array that represents the graph.
